This is my Advanced Human-Computer Interaction final project. It includes implemnting two different machine learning algorithms(SVM and Random Forest) and MLP on Bank Marketing dataset after doing necessary and required Preprocessing.Random Forest algorithm proved to be the most accurate algorithm between these three with an F1-Score of 97%.
In it's second phase, three different XAI algorithms(Counterfactual Explanations, SHAP and LIME) are also implemented to provide global and Local explantions for the users based on their inputs.
Here are some images form the Project :

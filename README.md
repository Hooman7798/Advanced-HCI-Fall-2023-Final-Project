This is my Advanced Human-Computer Interaction final project. It includes impleemnting two different machine learning algorithms(SVM and Random Forrest) and MLP on Bank Marketing dataset. In it's second
phase, three different XAI algorithms(Counterfactual Explanations, SHAP and LIME) are also implemented to provide global and Local explantions for the users based on their inputs.
